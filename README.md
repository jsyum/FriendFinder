FriendFinder is a compatibility testing app that matches the user with  the user most similar to them. The match is determined by comparing answers to personality-related questions.

Initially, possible matches include characters from a prepopulated database, but every new user who contributes adds their information to the database and becomes a possible match for a future user.
